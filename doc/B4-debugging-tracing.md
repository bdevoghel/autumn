# B4. Debugging & Tracing a Parse

## Checklist

Here are a few easy ways to debug and/or improve the performance of your parser:

- Write unit tests using [`TestFixture`]. See [an example] for the [Java grammar].
  
- Make sure assertions are enabled by passing the `-ea` argument to the Java virtual machine (`java`
command).
  
- If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, make sure to define the environment variable
 `AUTUMN_USE_CHAR_COLUMN` for more accurate hyperlinked file locations. The same applies if your
 editor supports hyperlinked file locations with columns expressed as a character offset (tabs count
 for 1) instead of width (tabs go to next multiple of the tab size).

- **!!!** Don't forget to disable call stack recording in production with
  `ParseOptions.recordCallStack(false).get()`

- Specify that the parse should be traced via the options:
```
ParseOptions options = ParseOptions.trace(true).get();
ParseResult result = Autumn.parse(grammar, input, options);
if (!result.fullMatch)
    //
else
    System.out.println(options.metrics);
```

- Use a `PEEK_ONLY` collect parser to print or set a breakpoint during the parse:
```
public rule myParser = seq(a, b, whatever)
    // add this line:
    .collect($ -> System.out.println("N was here!"), PEEK_ONLY); 
```

- How are your infix expression (e.g. arithmetic) implemented? If you're not using
[`LeftExpression`] and [`RightExpression`], it's very likely that your expressions are causing a
performance bug. It's also good to extend your scrutiny to other recursive constructs.

- Using reserved words in your language (words that identifiers are not allowed to match)? Make
  sure to use the [`reserved`] and [`identifier`] combinators to define them, as discussed in
  section [A7. Reserved Words And Identifiers][A7].

## Memoization

One solution to performance woes is to use memoization, as described in section [B2.
Memoization][B2].

A lot of PEG parsers are actually memoizing (but by default, not Autumn). However, experiments have
shown that full memoization is more often than not slower than no memoization at all!  See my [PhD
thesis (pdf)], Section 6.1.3, for a full discussion.

[B2]: B2-memoization.md

Memoization is useful in cases where the parser often tries the same rule at the same input
position. To some extent this is normal, and memoization may unlock modest gains. In particular,
selective memoization, guided by tracing (see the checklist above).

If memoization enables order-of-magnitude gains in your grammar, I would kindly suggest that
it might have some fundamental inefficiens â€” make sure you gave the checklist above due
consideration.

The [example grammar for Java][javagram] grammar is a perfect example. After experimenting
carefully, I ended up adding memoization to 5 rules, yielding a 12% parse time reduction. These
rules fell in two categories.

The first category were choices of items that are typically used as tokens: identifiers (remember
the list of keyword!), literals and primitive types.

The second categories included things that were parsed multiple times at the same location: list of
modifiers (`private`, `final`, ...) and list of annotations. For instance, modifiers can precede
both variable and method declarations.

## Left-Factoring

For my second category from the last section (things that were parsed multiple times at the same
location), there is another possible fix: left-factoring. To give you a trivial example, you could
rewrite:

```
public rule declaration = choice(
    seq(modifiers, method_declaration),
    seq(modifiers, field_declaration));
```

into:

```
public rule declaration =
    seq(modifiers, choice(method_declaration, field_declaration));
```

The issue with left-factoring is that outside trivial examples, it tends to make your grammars
uglier. It also requires some gymnastic to build the AST (often requiring the use of [`LOOKBACK`]).
That being said, the Java grammar also uses some left-factoring (try looking up `class_body_decl`
for an example).

Note that a big benefit of using [`LeftExpression`] and [`RightExpression`] (see section [A6.
Left-Recursion and Associativity][A6]) is that they essentially perform left-factoring for you
under the wraps.
